# Documentation Standards

All markdown documentation in this repository must follow these conventions.

## Guidelines

- Use sentence case for headers: "User authentication flow" not "User Authentication Flow"
- Maximum header depth is H3 - never use H4 or beyond
- Every document must include at least one Mermaid diagram
- Embed LLM hints in HTML comments for AI tool guidance
- Use kebab-case for filenames: `user-authentication.md`

## Template Usage

When creating new documentation:

1. Start from the appropriate template in `docs/*/TEMPLATE.md`
2. Fill in ALL sections - work through "not applicable" sections with AI assistance
3. Remove placeholder text but keep section headers
4. Add relevant Mermaid diagrams

## Diagram Requirements

Use Mermaid.js for all diagrams. Supported types:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[flowchart] --> B[sequence]
    B --> C[state]
    C --> D[ERD]
```

Always verify diagrams render correctly before committing.

## LLM Hints

Embed hints for AI tools using HTML comments:

```markdown
<!-- LLM HINT: This section covers X. Key context: Y. -->
```

Place hints at the start of complex sections to provide context.

## Context

This repository serves as a reference for markdown template best practices. Documentation quality directly impacts LLM productivity - poor structure leads to wasted tokens and broken inference. These rules enforce the consistency needed for both human and AI consumers.
